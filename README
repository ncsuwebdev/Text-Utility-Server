Installation:

You need to download Zend Framework and place the Zend folder inside /library.  The 
latest supported version is Zend Framework 1.11.2.


If you want to enable caching, you will need to create a directory somewhere in the 
filesystem that is writable.  You will then need to set the options in the 
/application/config/application.ini file as the following:

options.cacheOn = 1
options.cacheDir = <absolute path to your directory>


If you want to enable logging, you will need to create a directory and file somewhere
in the filesystem that is writable.  You will need to set the options in the
/application/config/application.ini file as the following:

options.logOn = 1
options.logDir = <absolute path to your directory>
options.logFile = <name of the file that is writable>
